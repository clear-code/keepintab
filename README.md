# KeepInTab + Options
WebExtension to prevent links to open in a new tab/window.
This extension removes certain target attributes from links. By default: every target attributes except named targets (referring to an existing window or iframe).

This is an modified version of the [KeepInTab](https://addons.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/addon/keepintab/). The only one difference is: the behavior is configurable.
